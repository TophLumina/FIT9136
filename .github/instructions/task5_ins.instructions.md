# Description

You are again working on the `BankAccount` class. Your goal is to write a suite of unit tests that cover a wide range of normal and edge-case behaviours which will check your work from the previous task.

You must:

* Write test cases for each public method outlined in the previous task.
* Test for **both** correct and incorrect inputs.
* Use `assertEqual`, `assertRaises`, and (optionally) other assertions like `assertIsInstance`, `assertGreaterEqual`, etc.
* Organise your tests using a testing framework such as `unittest`.

## Requirements

* **‚úÖSome Examples of Positive Cases:**
  * Check depositing and withdrawing valid amounts updates the balance correctly.
  * Check transferring between two valid accounts works as expected.
  * Check flagging / banning accounts prevents deposit/withdraw/transfer involving these accounts.
* ‚ùå **Negative Cases:**
  * Check Deposit/withdraw/transfer with invalid types & values.
* üß™ **Test Structure:**
  * Group related tests into test methods.

Remember, same as last task you should be using the errors from `custom_errors.py`

In order to be eligible to get full marks for this task you must make meaningful usage of the setup and teardown functionality provided in the unit test framework.
